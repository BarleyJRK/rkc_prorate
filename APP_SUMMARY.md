## Key Features

### Core Functionality

#### 1. **Proration Calculation Engine**

**What It Does:**
- Calculates exact cost per day for any billing period
- Applies per-day rate to active service days
- Accounts for varying month lengths (28-31 days)
- Handles leap years automatically
- Maintains full mathematical precision (no rounding until display)

**Calculation Method:**
```
Per Day Rate = Full Period Charge Ã· Total Days in Period
Prorated Amount = Per Day Rate Ã— Active Service Days
```

**Accuracy:**
- Uses full decimal precision internally
- Rounds only for display ($XX.XX)
- Consistent with industry best practices

---

#### 2. **Multi-Cycle Support**

**Supported Billing Cycles:**

1. **Commercial (Monthly)**
   - Bills: 1st of each month
   - Period: First to last day of month
   - Example: October 1-31 (31 days)

2. **R1A2 JAJO (Residential Quarterly)**
   - Quarters: Jan-Mar, Apr-Jun, Jul-Sep, Oct-Dec
   - Bills: Last day of first month in quarter
   - Example: Jul 1 - Sep 30, billed July 31

3. **R1A2 FMAN (Residential Quarterly)**
   - Quarters: Feb-Apr, May-Jul, Aug-Oct, Nov-Jan
   - Bills: Last day of first month in quarter
   - Example: Nov 1 - Jan 31, billed November 30

4. **R1A2 MJSD (Residential Quarterly)**
   - Quarters: Mar-May, Jun-Aug, Sep-Nov, Dec-Feb
   - Bills: Last day of first month in quarter
   - Example: Dec 1 - Feb 28/29, billed December 31

**Smart Period Detection:**

   - Next invoice will have correct amount
   - No immediate action required

2. **"$XX.XX (Credit)"**
   - Customer was already billed for full period
   - Service stopped early
   - Credit must be issued

3. **"$XX.XX (Charge)"**
   - Customer was already billed
   - Service started after billing
   - Additional charge must be collected

## Billing Cycles & Calculations

### How Proration Works

**Core Principle:** Customer pays only for days they have service

**Formula:**
```
Cost Per Day = Full Period Charge Ã· Total Days in Period
Prorated Charge = Cost Per Day Ã— Days of Service
```

### Example Calculation

**Scenario:** Residential customer (R1A2 FMAN) stops service

- **Period:** August 1 - October 31, 2025 (92 days)
- **Monthly Rate:** $10.00
- **Full Period Charge:** $10.00 Ã— 3 months = $30.00
- **Service Stop Date:** September 21, 2025
- **Days Used:** Aug 1-31 (31) + Sept 1-20 (20) = 51 days
- **Days Unused:** Sept 21-30 (10) + Oct 1-31 (31) = 41 days

**Calculation:**
```
Per Day Rate = $30.00 Ã· 92 = $0.326087 per day
Amount Used = $0.326087 Ã— 51 = $16.63
Credit Due = $30.00 - $16.63 = $13.37
```

**Result:** Customer receives a credit of **$13.37**

### Important Notes

1. **Stop dates are EXCLUDED** - If service stops Sept 21, last service day is Sept 20
2. **Start dates are INCLUDED** - If service starts Sept 21, billing begins Sept 21
3. **Monthly rate always used** - Even for quarterly customers, enter monthly rate
4. **Leap years handled** - February automatically adjusts for leap years
5. **Inclusive counting** - Both start and end dates of period are counted
