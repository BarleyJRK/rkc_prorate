- Check if you accidentally added extra digits
- Verify the monthly rate with customer records
- If legitimate rate is over $10,000, contact IT for limit adjustment

---

### Problem: "Warning: Unable to save calculation history"

**Cause:** Browser storage is full or disabled

## Tips & Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO:

1. **Always use "Show Calculation Details"** for complex calculations
   - Helps verify the math is correct
   - Useful for explaining to customers

   - Helps other staff understand the context

3. **Use "Copy Summary"** for documentation

4. **Double-check the service type**
   - Start vs Stop makes a big difference
   - Verify with customer before calculating

5. **Verify the billing cycle**

6. **Keep the calculator open** throughout your shift
   - History persists as long as the window is open

### ‚ùå DON'T:

   - The calculator handles this automatically

3. **Don't rely solely on history beyond 3 days**
   - Copy important calculations immediately
   - Save summaries in your ticketing system

4. **Don't calculate manually**
   - Always use the calculator for accuracy
   - Manual calculations are error-prone

5. **Don't ignore warnings**
